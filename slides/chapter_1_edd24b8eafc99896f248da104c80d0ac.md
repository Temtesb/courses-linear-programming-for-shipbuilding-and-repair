## What is linear programming?	

```yaml

`@part1`
Linear programming is an optimization technique that uses a few inputs to determine the best way to accomplish a task.  The task could be to increase throughput, decrease cost or minimize downtime.  The inputs to linear programming are:
- What is being optimized?
- What are the constraints?
- What are the variables?

The output of linear programming is the optimal configuration to accomplish the optimization.  An example below shows the benefits of using linear programming compared to assumptions of what is best.

For this course we are working through the text [Illustrated Guide to Linear Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Illustrated-Guide-Linear-Programming/dp/0486262588)

Management group 1:

Management that doesn't use linear programming chooses to make 3 of mockup A, 3 of B and 4 of C.  How many students can they send through the school in a year?
|HOURS|QUANTITY|Per Day|Per Year|
```

```

PER DAY	PER YEAR
A	2	3	12	3012
B	4	3	6	1506
C	8	4	4	1004
 Management can send a maximum of 1,004 students through the school per year.

Management group 2:

Goal: Maximize throughput

```
Space|HRs|QTY|PER DAY|PER YEAR
A    | 2 | ![]()2 |  8    |  2008
B      4	3     6         1506
C      8	5     5         1255
```
This management group can send 20% more students through the program per year.
