`@part1`
Linear programming is an optimization technique that uses a few inputs to determine the best way to accomplish a task.  The task could be to increase throughput, decrease cost or minimize downtime.  The inputs to linear programming are:
- What is being optimized?
- What are the constraints?
- What are the variables?

For this course we are working through the text [Illustrated Guide to Linear Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Illustrated-Guide-Linear-Programming/dp/0486262588)
